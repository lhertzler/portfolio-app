# **Luke Hertzler — Portfolio App**

A polished, production-grade Next.js portfolio built not just to showcase my work, but to demonstrate **how I architect real-world applications**. This project lives here publicly so teams, founders, and clients can see my development style, design approach, and engineering decisions in a real, working codebase.

This is the type of system I build for companies — clean, scalable, fast, and thoughtfully structured.

---

## 🎯 **What This Project Demonstrates About My Work**

### **1. Full-Stack Application Architecture**
This repo shows how I structure a modern app from the ground up:
- Modular file architecture  
- Server & client component strategy  
- API routing best practices  
- Shared layouts that preserve state  
- Data modeling & content organization  

If you're evaluating me for a Next.js, Shopify headless, or SaaS product — this is a glimpse of how I'd build yours.

---

### **2. UI/UX Craftsmanship**
Everything in this project is built to feel **smooth**, **intentional**, and **high-end**:

- Responsive layouts  
- Fluid animations  
- Motion-driven transitions  
- Accessible components  
- A full custom design system  

This is the level of detail and polish I deliver to any brand I work with.

---

### **3. Real App Behaviors, Not Just Pretty Pages**
This isn’t a static portfolio — it includes:

- A persistent audio player  
- A real blog engine  
- Portfolio case studies  
- Email-powered contact forms  
- Global UI toolset (command palette, theme system)  

I build features like this every day for founders and businesses who need something more than “just a website.”

---

### **4. Security-First Mindset**
From API routes to HTML sanitization to rate limiting, this repo demonstrates how I approach:

- Input validation  
- Securing endpoints  
- Protecting user-facing features  
- Managing secrets  
- Hardening attack surfaces  

If you're building anything customer-facing, scalable, or high-traffic — security is baked into my workflow.

---

### **5. Performance & SEO Awareness**
Everything is tuned for:

- Fast loads  
- Code splitting  
- Stable responsiveness  
- Proper metadata  
- Search engine visibility  

These aren’t afterthoughts — they’re part of my baseline.

## 🧩 **Tech Stack At a Glance**

- **Next.js (App Router)** — Full-stack React framework  
- **React + TypeScript** — Type-safe, scalable UI architecture  
- **Tailwind CSS & shadcn/ui** — Custom design system + reusable components  
- **Zustand** — Lightweight global state management  
- **Framer Motion** — High-end interaction & animation  
- **SendGrid** — Email delivery via API routes  
- **Web Audio API** — Custom audio visualization and persistent playback  

This mirrors the same modern stack I use when building client apps, SaaS tools, headless Shopify builds, or full product architectures.

## 🚀 **What This Project Says About Me as an Engineer**

### **I design experiences holistically**  
Not just components — flows, systems, and user journeys.

### **I build with maintainability in mind**  
Readable, consistent, and scalable code is a signature of mine.

### **I move fast without breaking things**  
Performance, accessibility, structure, and UX never get ignored.

### **I think like a founder**  
I’ve built products from zero → launch. I know how to ship and how to prioritize.

### **I can own the full stack, end to end**  
From architecture → UI → backend → deployment → polish.

If you're looking for someone who can take a concept and turn it into a real product — you're looking at it.

```

This is the same style of structure I use when building apps for clients and companies.

## 🛡️ **Security & Best Practices**

This repo intentionally does *not* include any secrets or sensitive data.

Implemented patterns include:

- Server-side validation  
- Proper input sanitization  
- XSS mitigation

- Security headers  
- HTTPS enforcement  

This is standard operating procedure for anything I build.
